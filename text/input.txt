Cache memory hides hundreds of cycles of main memory access latency and improves processor performance. When a miss occurs in cache, access to the main memory increases, therefore it is important to improve cache hit rate. Increasing the capacity of the cache improves caceh hit rate, but also increases access latency. Therefore, by using cache compression, substantial capacity can be increased.Various compression methods have been proposed based on characteristics of accessed data. Also, since the variable length compression of the cache line negatively affects the conventional cache replacement algorithm, compression-aware cache replacement algorithm is proposed . This paper introduces some of cahe compression method and discusses what will be the future researches related to cache compression.
